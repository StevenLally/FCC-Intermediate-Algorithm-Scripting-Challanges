# FCC-Intermediate-Algorithm-Scripting-Challanges
Collection of my solutions for some of the FCC Intermediate Algorithm Scripting Challanges

1. Wherefore-art-thou: "Make a function that looks through an array of objects (first argument) and returns an array of all objects that have matching name and value pairs (second argument). Each name and value pair of the source object has to be present in the object from the collection if it is to be included in the returned array."

2. Pig-Latin: "Translate the provided string to pig latin.  Pig Latin takes the first consonant (or consonant cluster) of an English word, moves it to the end of the word and suffixes an "ay".  If a word begins with a vowel you just add "way" to the end.  Input strings are guaranteed to be English words in all lowercase."
